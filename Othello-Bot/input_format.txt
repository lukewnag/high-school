This program takes in one string argument that is 64 characters long. Each character denotes a square on the Othello board, numbered like so:

1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
9 10 11 ...
...
...           62 63 64

If the character at a certain location is a '.', it means the corresponding square is empty. If a character is 'o', it represents a white token in the corresponding square, and if it is 'x', it represents a black token.
